# C-Assorted-Program
Assorted C Programs created by me for exploring the dynamics of C language.

## **Instructions** :
> Open a new "powershell terminal" and type ***gcc <file name>***. This will create a executable file named ***a.exe***. Then type ***.\a***, and this will run the C program and then provide input to the program and there itself get output from the program.
