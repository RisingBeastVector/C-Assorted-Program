# C-Assorted-Program
Assorted C Programs created by me for exploring the dynamics of C language.

## **Instructions** :
> Open a new "powershell terminal" and type _gcc <file name>_. This will create a executable file named _a.exe_. Then type _.\a_, and this will run the C program and then provide input to the program and there itself get output from the program.
